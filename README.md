##Genetic algorithm

Curve fitting is a well researched problem. There are few approaches that use 
genetic algorithms for curve fitting. We try a new approach to curve fitting 
where we don't focus on performance but rather try to create "real" equations.
This differs from the traditional approach, where parameters of a harmonic function
are varied to produce a specific curve. 

The visualization is written in D3 and javascript; however, the server and genetic
algorithm are written entirely in clojure.

##Setup and run

    lein run -m myapp.core

Then navigate your browser to localhost:5000 to see some graphs
